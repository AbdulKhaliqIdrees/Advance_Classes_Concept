Day 2: Advanced Class Concepts
Overview
Day 2 expanded upon the foundational concepts by exploring how to pass members of one class to another class and the concept of nested classes.
Topics Covered
Passing Members of One Class to Another Class
This concept involves using the attributes and methods of one class within another class. This can be effectively demonstrated using static methods. Static methods facilitate the interaction between classes without needing class instantiation, providing a clear example of how to pass class members between classes.
Nested Class
A nested class is a class defined within another class. This structure is useful for logically grouping classes that are only used in one place, providing better organization and encapsulation. Nested classes help in maintaining a cleaner and more understandable code structure, especially when the nested class is only relevant in the context of its enclosing class.
